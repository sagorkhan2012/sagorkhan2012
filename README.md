Hi, I am MD Shakhawat Hossain Khan

I am learning frontend development and practicing step by step to improve my skills. Right now I am focused on:
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- JavaScript (learning)
- React (beginner)

I use GitHub to upload my practice projects, track my progress, and learn slowly with consistency. My long-term goal is to create real projects and build a clean portfolio.

Thank you for visiting my profile.
